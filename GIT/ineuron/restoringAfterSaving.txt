suppose you did a commit


now you did some modification and saved.
previous version is lost, since you have saved the file.


now you added it to staged area

How to get previous version(i.e. version just after latest commit)


To unstage it, we do

>> git restore --staged <filename>
another command is 
>> git reset HEAD <file>

Now file is unstaged, but it is still modified after saving previously.


To undo changes and revert to version that was after previous commit, we do 


>> git restore <file name>


another way to make your file same as it was in last commit

>> git checkout -- <filename>
