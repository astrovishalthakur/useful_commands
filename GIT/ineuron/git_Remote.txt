Create a repo at github.

copy https url

go to local folder which you want to make as repo in local system

intialize git

>> git init

now add remote link

>> git add remote origin <copied_url>

To see your head pointer in remote,
just type

>> git remote

To see more information using verbose

>> git remote -v

To see url of remote and other informations

>> cat .git/config

Pushing our code on remote repo

>> git push -u <remote-head> <branch-you-want-to-push>

usually remote-head is called origin, and generally ypu pust "main" branch to remote, so above command becomes

>> git push -u origin main

By default, origin is name of reference to remote
To see it

>> git remote --verbose

We can rename this remote reference to somethin else, e.g. "disco" like this

>> git remote rename origin disco

To clone a git repository from github

go to repo on github

click clone button

copy https link url

then

>> git clone <url>

above command will clone the remote repo to your computer with same name as on remote.

To give you own name in local system, do 

>> git clone <url> <new_name>

To push changes to our remote repo using master

>> git push

Now suppose you have changes in remote not in local, to get those changes

first we will just import information about those commits, it will not modify files in local repo just tell us the difference

>> git fetch

now to see changes

>> git log --oneline --all

or 

>> git log --oneline origin/main

Now to merge origin/main to local

>> git merge origin/main



To fetch and merge in one go

>> git pull

To see if local and remote are in sync or not

>> git status -uno
