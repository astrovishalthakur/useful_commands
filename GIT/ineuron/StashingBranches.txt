suppose you are no branch1

you did some modifications there

you didn't add or commit changes

now you tried to go back to main branch.

It will not allow you to do so and will say that all your chages will be deleted, so you better commit these changes before checking out to main.


Now there might be the case that you work on branch1 is still incomplete and you don't want to commit it yet.

In these case, you can stash your changes.

Stashing helps you to store your changes temporarily so that you can come back to branch1 and work on them again.


To stash things

>> git stash save "<message to stash>"

Now if we do git status, we will see working directory is clean.
