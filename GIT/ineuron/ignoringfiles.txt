How to ignore files

Sometimes we don't want git to track some files.

Method 1:

You have some files, which are not tracked by git (not staged but modified).
And some files which are being tracked(staged)

now to see what files will be cleaned

>> git clean -n

And to clean all these files,

>> git clean -f

Cleaning means deleting or removing untracked file.
Above command will delete untracked files from local directory.


Second method is .gitignore file

We can just put all files which we don't want git to track.

also 

.gitignore also needs to be added to git repo

just do 

>> git add .gitignore

>> git commit -m "gitignore file added"


Now we can add things in .gitignore

like

# hash us used for comments in .gitignore

*.mp4 
*.js
# above line will ignore all files with extension .mp4 and javascript files

assets/videos/

# above line will ignore videos folder in assets folder.


Now suppose you have a file with .js extension you want being tracked, but since you have asked .gitignore to ignore all .js files, we need to specify it explicitly to not ignore <importantfiel.js>


we will add in .gitignore

!importantfile.js
