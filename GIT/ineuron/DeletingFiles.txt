To see difference between previously commited file and new version of same file. we can do

>> git diff


If we want to only compare file in staged area, we can do

>> git diff --staged 

now to Delete commited files

you should never delete them directly.

>> rm <filename>

It will confuse git which was tracking the files but now they seems to be found no-where.

To delete files so that even git knows.

we will do

>> git rm <filename>

This will delete file and git will know it as well
