To see list of stashes

>> git stash list

output will be something like

stash@{0} : On <branch-name>: <stashing message>
stash@{1} : On <branch-name>: <stashing message>

Now go to branch where you stash lives.


To see information about particular stash

do 

>> git stash show stash@{<stash-number>}

for example, if you want to see information (files modified, no. of insertions, deletions), in 3rd stash, you can do something like

>> git stash show stash@{3}


we can save mulitple stash, and on different branches, just make sure that you when you are retreiving the stash, you mention it correctly.

HOW TO RETREIVE STASH

>> git stash pop stash@{0}

to retreive latest stash

>> git stash pop

There is another way of retreiving stash

>> git stash apply stash@{0}

Difference between pop and apply is 

On doing pop you remove stash from list of stashs

On doing apply, you do get your stash back but it still remains in list.


basically, pop is cut and paste
apply is copy and paste.

Apply is used if we want to apply same stash to multiple files.
