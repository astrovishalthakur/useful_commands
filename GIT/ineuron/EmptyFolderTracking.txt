git doesn't keep a track of empty folder

suppose you create new empty folder and do 

>> git status

It will show that no changes were made.

Now some times it is desirable to track even empty folders, when we need them in future.

Pepole usually take care of this matter by putting a random or empty file in that folder.

Now since folder is not empty, git will track it.

A neat trick is to add a file with . so that it remains hidden.

e.g. 

>> folder/.gitkeep

now folder will be tracked an .gitkeep will remain hidden. Also we can name the file anything, gitkeep is popular name as contrary to gitignore.
