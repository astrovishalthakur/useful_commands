now there is no concept of renaming in linux.
In linux if you want to rename, you need to move it into directory with new name.

Git is also made by developer of git, so we do same here

we can't rename a branch, so we move branch to branch with <new name>.


>> git branch -m <current_branch> <new_branch>


To delete a branch

>> git branch -d <branch_name>
or
>> git branch --delete <branch_name>

We can't delete current branch.


Now suppose we made some changes in sub-branch and commited the changes.

now we switched back to main branch.

now changes done in sub-branch is not still merged with main.

if we want to delete sub-branch

>> git branch -d <branch-name>

this will throw error saying that 

The branch '<sub-branch>' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D <sub-branch>'.

So to forcefully delete a branch we do it with flag -D

>> git branch -D <branch-name>
