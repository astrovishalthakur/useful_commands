suppose you are working with a project


you have made many commits


now its tough to remember commits by SHAs

We can assign tags to commits

>> git tag -a <tag-name> -m "<message>" <4-5 sha lines>

e.g.

>> git tag -a ticket123 -m "tag with name ticket123" ab89e8445


To see all tags present

>> git tag --list or -l

To see tags with there messages

>> git tag -l -n

Deleting tag

>> git tag -d <tag-name>

e.g.

>> git tag -d ticket123


TAGS are not pushed to remote automatically

but they are pulled automatically when we do a pull



Pushing tags to remote

push one by one

>> git push origin <tag-name>

To push all tags

>> git push origin --tags
