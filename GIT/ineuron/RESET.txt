RESET means we will loose data.


Different kinds of reset

- soft safe
- mixed default
- hard caution

soft - just points towards another SHA

mixed - points towards another SHA and makes your staging area a copy of repo(this is default)

hard - points toward another SHA, makes your staging area a copy of repo and makes your local files exactly same as repo.


>> git reset --soft/hard/mixed <hash> filename
