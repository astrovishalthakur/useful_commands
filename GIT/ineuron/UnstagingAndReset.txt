Git Checkout

Suppose you had a file commited.
You made some changes in file.

>> git diff 

above command will show you the changes made after previous commit.

To reset these changes, or
suppose if you have saved your work in local directory but not yet staged and commited, you can undo the changes by 


############################################
GIT CHECKOUT TO UNDO CHANGES IN WORKING AREA
############################################

git checkout command

>> git checkout -- <file-name>

to discard all changes

>> git checkout .



above command will undo the changes and make file same as it was when we did last commit.
Now above command works if you have not added the new files to staging area



If you have added you modified file to staging area, we need to unstage it

command for unstaging a file is 

>> git rm --cached <file-name>

reset command can be littel dangerous sometimes. so only use above one.

>> git reset HEAD <file-name>

To unstage all files use .

>> git reset HEAD .

or we can do

>> git restore --staged <filename>

now to restore changes,

>> git checkout -- <filename>
