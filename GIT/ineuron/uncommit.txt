we can't actually uncommit things, since every commit generates a hash and that hash is used in generating hash for next commit as well.

So every commit has after commits dependent on it.

But since last or most recent commit doesn't have next commits who are dependent on it, we can edit that last commit.


Although editing commit is not generally used, it's most common use is when we want to make a very small change in file which is not worth making new commit.

In this case, we can just edit the last commit.

To do that,

first just modify your file

now stage it

>> git add <file name>

now instead of commiting it directly, we will append it with help of --append flag

to do that, do

>> git commit --amend -m "message"

above command will not create new commit but edit the previous commit with this new message.

So basically this command can also be used to change commit message.
