We know we do git commit like this

>> git commit -m "some message"

but sometimes, we need to add additional description of the commit

so we can actually do 

>> git commit

now git will open a text editor, where we can write commit message.

We can also add body or description if we leave one line after message and then type.

e.g.

TEXT EDITOR
	
	1. This is commit message
	2.	-- empty line --
	3. This is body or additional description.
