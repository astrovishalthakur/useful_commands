create multiple files:  touch filename.ext filename2.ext filename3.ext

show contents of directory:  ls

show current directory path:  pwd

go to d drive: cd D:

absoulte path begins with forward slash: cd /Users/Vishal\ Thakur

slash signifies root directory that is starting of c drive
tilde signifies home directory i.e. Your folder in users folder

relative path: cd ../../pets

to make directory: mkdir hello hi hola
will make 3 folders with hello, hi and hola names

make a folder one folder up: mkdir ../hello

make hello here and hola one folder up: mkdir hello ../hola

to look information about a command: man "command"
e.g.  man ls
man command is not present in git bash, so we will use --help
e.g. ls --help   or     dir --help


we will see some flags which we can pass along the commands
e.g. ls -s lists contents in sorted order
ls -l lists contents with detailed information.
we can also combine multiple flags 


to see what directories you make while using mkdir, use -v
e.g.  mkdir -v hello hola hi.

to create a file use touch command
touch is actually use to access premade files, it just updates the access time
but if a file doesn't exist, then it will create one for us.
e.g.  touch filename.extension  
      touch hello.txt


permanently delete a file: rm <filename.ext>

delete a empty folder: rmdir <foldername>
delete a non empty folder: rm -rf <foldername>
