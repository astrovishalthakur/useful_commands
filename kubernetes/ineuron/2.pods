Now again to see created pods

>> kubectl get pods

following output will be shown


NAME    READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
hello   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          9s


ready 0/1 means that 0 pods running, but 1 should be running


after some time when you again do above command, you will see that now your container has started and pod is running

NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello   1/1     Running   0          4m9s
