If you want to run the MLflow packed project using MLproject file

you can either do

>> mlflow run .

this will see MLproject file and find conda.yaml file and create new environment as specified in conda.yaml file.

To use current activated env without creating new one, you could do

>> mlflow run . --no-conda

FutureWarning: `--no-conda` is deprecated and will be removed in a future MLflow release. Use `--env-manager=local` instead.

you can also provide parameters in command, parameters are prespecified in MLproject file

>> mlflow run . -P alpha=0.7 -P l1=0.1 --no-conda
