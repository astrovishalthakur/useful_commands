creating conda env

>> conda create --name <env-name>

e.g.

>> conda create --name myFirstEnv

now this env will be stored where you anaconda resides, 

that is /c/Users/Anaconda3/envs

but this will fill our c drive, 

to store env in particular directory, we use --prefix flag

>> conda create --prefix <env-name>

e.g.

creating env with python 3.7 would look like

>> conda create --prefix ./env python=3.7 -y

-y flag is to give yes to all permissions.



To list all envs

>> conda env list


To activate env

>> conda activate <env-name>


to deactivate

>> conda deactivate

there's a environment called base, which is always active and helps running conda commands in terminal.

if you deactivate it, conda commands won't run,

simply close and reopen the terminal.
