TO install rasa, we need to create conda environment first.

>> conda create --name <env-name>

This will create a conda env in 

path: C/Users/Vishal Thakur/anaconda3/env/<env-name>

now activate conda 

conda activate <env-name>

now we can install rasa using 

>> pip install rasa

but above method will take a long time.

rasa has an dependency called tensorflow which is very large..

So we will install tensorflow seperately using conda

>> conda install ujson
>> conda intall tensorflow
>> pip intall rasa

above method will take less time
