we can enter mysql using mysql command line client,

but we can also do so using other terminals,

type

>> mysql -u root -p
now type password

To see databases,

>> show databases;

Create database

>> create database <database-name>;

Use database

>> use <database-name>;

delete database

>> drop database <database name>;

you can also save these commands in a file and then run that file

create a folder, in that create a file with ".sql" extension.

now open terminal and navigate to directory where you have your ".sql" file stored.
