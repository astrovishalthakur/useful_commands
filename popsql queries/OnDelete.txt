--deleting entries in table when they have foreign keys associated with them
-- now we can do two things in this case
-- suppose employee 102 is manager of a branch and have mgr_id as foreign key linking to emp_id of employee table.
-- 1. we can set on delete null   means set value of mgr_id  = null in branch table
-- 2. we can do on delete cascade.  means delete the entire row in branch table where mgr_id is 102

DELETE FROM employee
WHERE emp_id = 102;

SELECT * FROM branch;

SELECT * FROM employee;


DELETE FROM branch WHERE branch_id = 2;

SELECT * FROM branch_supplier;
