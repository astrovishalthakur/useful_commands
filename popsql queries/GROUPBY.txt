used to group row together based on some condition.

e.g.

we have following data

name   class

vishal  12
sonia   12
pooja   12
mohit   10
kushal  10
kartik  10
sujal   9

then following command 

SELECT name, class FROM students
GROUP BY class

will return 

name   class

Vishal 12
mohit  10
sujal   9

We see that first name out of all names who are in similar class are shown.
Other rows are still present there, but since they are grouped together, we don't see them in output. Sonia and Pooja are still with Vishal but we don't see them.

Now question is, Why use GROUP BY

We actually use GROUP BY in combination of other methods

e.g. COUNT

SELECT name, class, COUNT(*) FROM students
GROUP BY class;
