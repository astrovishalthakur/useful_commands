when you want to specify some options only out of which values can be assigned to a variable, we use ENUMS

e.g

we have to store size of t-shirt, then we can specify some sizes, and variable can store only out of them.


CREATE TABLE shirts(
	name VARCHAR(40),
	size ENUM("small", "medium", "large", "X-large"),
);

INSERT INTO shirts(name, size)
VALUES("polo shirt", "small"),

("dress shirt", "big");  --> this command will not work since "big" is not defined for size.

There is another data type called

size SET("", "small", "large")

as you can see SET can also store null values, but ENUM can't.
