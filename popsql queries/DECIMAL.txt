we can enter decimal values like

below statement will create a DECIMAL variable called amount which can Total of 5 digits including after decimal and it store 2 values after decimal.

>> amount DECIMAL(5, 2);

WE have FLOAT as well which works in same way

>> amount FLOAT;

but FLOAT can change values after some point of values(rounding up the number on its own)

but DECIMAL keeps the exact value, so it is reccommended to use.
