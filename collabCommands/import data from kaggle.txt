1. Install the Kaggle library
! pip install kaggle

2. Make a directory named “.kaggle”
! mkdir ~/.kaggle

3. Copy the “kaggle.json” into this new directory
! cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/

4. Allocate the required permission for this file.
! chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

Step 4: Download datasets
Kaggle host two types of datasets:
 Competitions and Datasets. 
The procedure to download any type remains 
the same with just minor changes.



##Downloading Competitions dataset:

! kaggle competitions download <name-of-competition>


##Downloading Datasets:

##These datasets are not part of any competition. You can download these datasets by:

! kaggle datasets download <name-of-dataset>

##In case you get a dataset with a zip extension,
##you can simply use the unzip command of Linux to extract the data:

! unzip <name-of-file>


##Tip 1: Download Specific Files
##You just saw how to download datasets from Kaggle in Google Colab.
## It is possible that you are only concerned about a specific file and want to download
##only that file. 
##Then you can use the “-f” flag followed by name of the file. 
##This will download only that specific file. 
##The “-f” flag works for both competitions and datasets command.

Example:

! kaggle competitions download google-smartphone-decimeter-challenge -f baseline_locations_train.csv



##Simply upload the “kaggle.json” to your Google Drive. 
##For simplicity, upload it in the root folder rather than any folder structure.

2. Next, mount the drive to your notebook:


3. The initial command for installing the Kaggle library
 and creating a directory named “.kaggle” remains the same:

! pip install kaggle
! mkdir ~/.kaggle


!cp /content/drive/MyDrive/kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
