Just like we had urls.py in our project folder, we can also create new urls.py for each app.

go to your project folder (myapp here)

create new file called urls.py

here we will create different routes that will be connected to different views.

You will create you views in views file, checkout that in views file of your 'myapp' application.


You have one urls.py file for entire project, and then separate urls.py for each application.

'urls.py' in project will route you to different apps(like myapp, etc.). 
and 'urls.py' in myapp(or other application) will route you to different views (like home, contact, etc.).


so suppose you go to link "www.demo.com/myapp/home"

in above url, "www.demo.com" will take you to project website.

"www.demo.com/myapp" will take you to 'myapp' application using 'urls.py' in project folder (demo)

and now any thing after this link, like "www.demo.com/myapp/home" will be handled by 'urls.py' file of application (myapp's urls.py).

so request goes like this


server -> project's urls.py -> applications' urls.py -> response

or in our case

(demo's server[website]) -> (demos/urls.py) [contains base urls of all apps] -> (myapp/urls.py) [contains urls of all views in myapp] -> (httpResponse) [from home function/view in views.py file].


urls.py contains list of all urls, known as urlpatterns.

each url in demo's urlpatterns should be connected to an app, or admin(by default)

each url in myapp's urlpatterns should be connected with a view(a function defined in views.py).
