Let's see how can we render database using views.

Let's create a todos.html in templates directory.
(here we will use jinja to display database items using a variable)

Then we will create a todos function in views.py
(here we can render todos.html file when todos() function is called. Here we will also pass that variable which jinja will display in todos.html

After creating a todos view, we will create a url for it in urls.py list of urlpatterns.

Then we can runserver and if we go to todos route (i.e. www.demo.com/todos/) we can see our items (if there are any)
