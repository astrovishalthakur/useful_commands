DJANGO PROJECT
++++++++++++++++

Django project is the overall container for your web application. It is a collection of settings, configurations, and multiple Django applications that together form a complete web application. A project typically represents the entire website or web service you are building.

In a Django project, you'll find settings that define various aspects of your application, such as database configuration, middleware, static files, templates, and more. A project can contain multiple Django applications, each serving a specific functionality or feature of the website.


To create a new Django project, you can use the following command:


>> django-admin startproject project_name

After creating the project, its directory structure might look like this:

project_name/
├── manage.py
└── project_name/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── asgi.py
    ├── settings.py
    ├── urls.py
    └── wsgi.py

DJANGO APPLICATION

A Django application is a modular component within a Django project that serves a specific functionality or set of related functionalities.

(IMPORTANT)

Applications are meant to be reusable and can be plugged into different projects, allowing you to keep your code organized and maintainable.

For example, if you are building an e-commerce website, you might have separate applications for handling user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, and payment processing. Each application focuses on a specific area of the website.


To create a new Django application, you can use the following command within your project directory:


>> python manage.py startapp app_name

After creating an application, its directory structure might look like this:

app_name/
├── migrations/
├── __init__.py
├── admin.py
├── apps.py
├── models.py
├── tests.py
└── views.py

Each application can have its models, views, templates, static files, and tests specific to its functionality.
