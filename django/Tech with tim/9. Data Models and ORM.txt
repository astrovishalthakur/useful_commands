We create data models in models.py file of our application(myapp) that we can access from django.

Django provides ORM (object relational mapping)

meaning, we can write python code to create different database models, which will later automatically be converted to some structural database schema like SQL.

 
Then we will make something known as migrations.
These migrations automates the code to turn these models to databases like SQL, MongoDb, etc.


We will go to models.py file of our app, and create a model there in form of python class


After that we need to register that model in our apps admin.py file.
