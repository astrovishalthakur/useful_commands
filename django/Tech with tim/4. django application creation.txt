Right now you are in your django project directory i.e. demo.

you will have there a file called manage.py and another directory called demo.

This is where we will create our new app.

Type command

>> python manage.py startapp <application-name>


Now you have created the app (let's say its name is myapp).

Now you need to go tell django project about newly created app.

1. You will go inside second demo directory.
2. Go to settings.py
3. look for INSTALLED_APPS list
4. add there new item 
5. this new item should be name of your app in strings.

Suppose you app is called myapp, then INSTALLED_APPS should look like 

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'myapp'
]
