django admin panel is useful tool which helps us manage many things like users and models.


to work with django admin panel, we need to create a user which will basically be an admin.

let's see how we do that.

go to terminal and type following command.


>> python manage.py createsuperuser

then it will ask for some details you can give it(email is optional).

now you can runserver
>> python manage.py runserver

now if you go to route

"<base-route>/admin"

or say a local route

"localhost:8000/admin"

it will ask you to enter username and password. 

when you login, it will display you a django admin dashboard where you are the boss. You can add new user, change data of existing users, create new admins, and many more functions.
