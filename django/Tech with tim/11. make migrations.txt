so any time you make a change to your database models, you need to somehow update it manually. This is called making migrations.

migrations are also automatic code which django will apply to change your models and update them while maintaining original data.

You do that by typing following command

>> python manage.py makemigrations

You have to run this command every single time you make some changes to any of your database models.

It will give output like this

Migrations for 'myapp':
  myapp/migrations/0001_initial.py
    - Create model TodoItems


after that we will type command

>> python manage.py migrate

above command will finally apply migrations and update the database for us.

Now we will run again our server using command 

>> python manage.py runserver

and it will not give us any error that it gave previously.
