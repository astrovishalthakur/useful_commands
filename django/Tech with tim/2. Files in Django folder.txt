When you create django project, it creates a directory of same name with bunch of files in it. Let's see what do these files do.

1. __init__.py
Tells python to treat it like a python package

2. asgi.py and wsgi.py
We don't need to modify these files.
They are special configuration files and helps django deal with web server.

3. settings.py
Contains different settings.
We will go there whenever we need to install andy django applications, plugins, middleware conf., as well as deal with different type of database engines. 

4. urls.py
Help configure different url routes which we can direct to our django applications.

5. manage.py
Acts as a command line tool and helps us to run command like make db migrations, run python servers, create users for django app.
