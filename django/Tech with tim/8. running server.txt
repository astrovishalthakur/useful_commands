to run your django project locally, you can do following

cd to your project directory (via terminal) i.e. demo in our case.

there you will see manage.py and myapp/ directory.

now in terminal, type following command

>> python manage.py runserver


your server will start serving you.

It will run, but also give some warnings that migrations are not applied. We will apply them later.
