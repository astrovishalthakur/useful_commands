Templates are html files which can be used to make views display dynamic data (like webpages)

first create "templates" folder inside our application.

demo/myapp/templates

make sure you only name this templates else it won't work.

inside templates, we can create html pages.

we can use jinja templating language which allows us to display dynamic data.

suppose you create a home.html page inside templates, now you can go to your views.py file, and attach it to home function as 

def home(request):
    return render(request, "home.html")

where render is function from django.shortcuts.

Now whenever we go to /home route, home() function from views.py will run and it will return home.html from templates.
