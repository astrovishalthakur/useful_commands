now even though we have created a project, it doesn't mean that our app is created.

We need to again create folder specific to our app

suppose we are creating a blog and want to name our app "blog"

then go to terminal, where manage.py resides and do

>> python manage.py start-app blog

this will create a new folder with name blog.
