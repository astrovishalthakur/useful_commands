after all basic setup, we can create an admin so that we can use admin page.

>> python manage.py makemigrations

output will be : no changes detected.

(If we had created our own databases or made some changes in default database, we would have seen those changes inplace of above output.)

makemigration detect the changes and make django update the database.


so we will migrate.

>> python manage.py migrate

now creating admin

>> python manage.py createsuperuser

enter details.

Now you can acess admin page.
