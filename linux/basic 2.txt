# copy command

>> cp options source destination

>> cp file1.txt file2.txt

# copy to directory

>> cp filee1.txt dir2

# copy multiple files to dir

>> cp file1.txt file2.txt dir2

# if file1.txt is already in dir2, it will be overwritten automatically with contents of file1 we are copying.

# to ask before overwriting, we use -i flag

>> cp file1.txt dir1/

# if dir1 already have file1.txt, it will ask us if we want to overwrite or not.

# we can also give absolute path

# . is used to show current directory as / is used for root

>> cp ../file1.txt ../file2.txt /home/astrovishalthakur/sDesktop/dir1

# copy dir1 to dir2 if dir2 is not empty(use -r "recursive", if its not empty)

>> cp -R dir1 dir2

# if dir2 doesn't exist, dir1 content will go to dir2
# if dir2 exists, dir1 will be copied whole in dir2


# move command

mv options source destination

# mv can be used to rename a file

# suppose we have a file named file1.txt, we can name it file2.txt as

mv file1.txt file2.txt

# move file1.txt, file2.txt to directory called dir

mv file1.txt file2.txt dir/

# if dir already contains file1.txt, it's content will be overwritten.

# we can avoid it by -i flag, which will ask us before overwriting

mv -i file1.txt dir/

# move dir1 inside dir2(it's present)

mv dir1 dir2

# if destination directory is not present, it just renames the directory

# if dir2 isn't present
# mv dir1 dir2 will rename dir1 to dir2

# -v is verbose and can be used to display information about operations taking place.
