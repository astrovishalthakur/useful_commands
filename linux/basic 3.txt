# less command

cat filename.txt

above command displays whole file in terminal.

if the file is very large, it will take its sweet ass time to print all the contents.

and after printing all contents, we can see the contents of little lower part of file only

it won't let us scroll to the top of file..

basically there is a scrolling limit on terminal.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
To get solution of this problem, we use less command.

>> less filename.txt

This will only print that much content of file as much your terminal size is.
