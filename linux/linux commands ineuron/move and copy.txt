Copy command

>> cp filename.txt directoryname


move contents of one directory to other

>> cp -r dir1 dir2


if dir2 exists, whole dir1 folder will be copied to dir2.


if dir2 doesn't exists, contents of dir1 will be copied to dir2


Move command

>> mv filename.txt dirname


move directory to directory

>> mv dir1 dir2


if dir2 exists, dir1 is moved whole to dir2

if dir2 doesn't exist, contents of dir1 are moved to dir2 and dir1 being empty is now deleted. So basically we are renaming dir1 to dir2
