Aliases are like custom shortcuts used to represent a command (or set of commands) executed with or without custom options.

- Creating aliases
- Deleting aliases
- Making permanent aliases


To see current alias

>> alias

Now to create our own alias

>> alias <alias-name>=<'command for which alias needs to be created'>

e.g.

to create alias "pp" for command ls -lrt

>> alias pp='ls -lrt'

To remove alias

we do

>> unalias pp


Now how to make alias permanent

Now after rebooting the system our alias will get deleted.

To set alias permanently, we need to update bashrc file


opening bashrc file

>> vi .bashrc

go to end of the file

type

alias pp='ifconfig'

now save the file

>> :wq!

now if you type 

>> pp

you wont see ifconfig

we need to reload the bashrc file

to do that we do

>> source ~/.bashrc


now we will do

>> pp

we will see ifconfig is executed.

Now even if we reboot the system, our alias will still work.

To delete this permanent alias

just go to bashrc

>> vi .bashrc

Delete the command we wrote at the end of the file.

save and exit

reload the file

>> source ~/.bashrc
