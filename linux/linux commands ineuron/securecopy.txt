SCP or secure copy is a command line utility that allow you to secure copy files and directories between two locations.


With scp you can copy a file or directory

- From your local system to a remote system
- From a remote system to your local system
- Between two remote systems from you local system

Connect your ubuntu local machine to remote machine.

Talked in file:----->  sshconnect

now how to copy file from host system and paste to remote system

First get ip address of remote system(ubuntu in our case)  using 

>> ifconfig

Now go to directory where file is in local system(wsl in our case)

now to copy file from wsl to ubuntu de

>> scp <filename.txt> <hostusername>@<host ip address>:/path where you need to paste file

e.g.

>> scp hello.txt astrovishalthakur@192.168.1.3:/home/astrovishalthakur/Desktop/ 


above command will send file with same name as in host, 

to paste file in remote with new name just add that new name after path.

e.g.

>> scp <filename.txt> <hostusername>@<host ip address>:/path where you need to paste file/<new-filename.txt>

>> scp hello.txt astrovishalthakur@192.168.1.3:/home/astrovishalthakur/Desktop/new-name.txt


To copy paste folder from local to remote

>> scp -r <folder-name> <host-username>@<host ip address>:/path



Now to copy from host and paste to local

>> scp <hostname>@<host-ip>:/path-of-file <path in local where you want to paste>(. for current directory)

e.g.

>> scp astrovishalthakur@192.168.1.3:/home/astrovishalthakur/Desktop/new-name.txt .

We can also do from remote 1 to remote 2 if both of them are connected with our local.
