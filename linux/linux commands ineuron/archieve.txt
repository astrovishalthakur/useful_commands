To archive files into .tar folder

suppose we have file1.txt, file2.txt.  To archive them

>> tar -cf zippedfile.tar file1.txt file2.txt

To see verbose information

>> tar -cvf zipped.tar file1.txt file2.txt

To extract contents of archived file

>> tar -xvf zippedfile.tar

Archive whole folder.. we have a folder called fol

>> tar -cvf zippedfolder.tar fol/

now whole folder has been zipped as zippedfolder.tar

we don't want to extract just view the contents.

>> tar -tf zippedfolder.tar
