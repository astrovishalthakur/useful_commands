Suppose we want to search a file in our system.

we can use locate command

before that we will update our mlocate database

go to home 

>> cd ~

now go to following path

>> cd /var/lib/mlocate/

now update the mlocate.db

>> sudo updatedb


now you can search for the file


>> locate <filename.txt>


there is also a find command

>> find <path>

e.g.

>> find /home/astrovishal/hola/ -name <filename.txt>

to ignore case we use -iname instead of -name

>> find /home/astrovishal/hola/ -iname <filename.txt>



searching contents of file using grep command

to search word mango in file

>> grep mango <filename.ext>




if we want exact keyword and not words which contains the words
e.g. if we have
apple and pineapple then after searching apple we shouldn't get pineapple which we will normally get

>> grep -w apple <fielname.txt>

To ignore case of searched word

>> grep -i <word> <filename.txt>



print contents of 2 lines after searching the word

>> grep -A2 <word> <filename.txt>


Print two lines before word

>> grep -B2 <word> <filename.txt>




Two lines after and before

>> grep -A2 -B2 <word> <filename.txt>


If there are multiple files in a directory, and you need to find a word

>> grep -r <word> /path_to_directory



if we don't want to see the searched word and only see other content of file

>> grep -v <word> <filename.txt>
