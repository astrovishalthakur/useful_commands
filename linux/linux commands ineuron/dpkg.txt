dpkg is package mangager, just like pip in python

it's a low level pakage manager meaning it can only install packages but doesn't install dependency.

it helps in installing .deb files.

installing a zoom package

>> sudo dpkg -i zoom_and64.deb

above -i means install and zoom_and64.deb is debian file.

now starting zoom

>> zoom

now removing zoom or uninstalling it

>> sudo dpkg -r zoom


list all packages

>> dpkg -l

search package or
get details of a package

>> dpkg -s <package-name>
