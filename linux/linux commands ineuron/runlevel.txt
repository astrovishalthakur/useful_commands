TO see runlevel type
>> runlevel

N 5 means we are at gui or graphical level.


To see name of run level
>> systemctl get-default


switch to run level3 i.e. pure command line

>> sudo vi /etc/default/grub

now a file will open 
go down
field saying command line linux will be empty ""
fill 3 in there,

save the file using
>> wq


now update grub

>> sudo update-grub


and reboot the system

>> sudo reboot now


Now ubuntu will open without any gui and in pure command line interface,
in servers we only get n3 level that is command line.

now login with your id and password,

check again for runlevel.

>> runlevel

>> systemctl get-default

To again get gui

do all things same

>> sudo vi /etc/default/grub


now remove 3 from field grub command line linux

save file and update grub

reeboot again.
