--Done in runlevel lecture

starting, stoppin, restarting service

we use words like

start

>> sudo service <service-name> start

e.g.

>> sudo service flaskapp.service start


(do same for other actions as well)
stop
restart
reload

other format is 

>> sudo systemctl start <Servicename>
e.g.

>> sudo systemctl start flaskapp.service

Enabling and disabling service

enable
disable


FORMATS

>> sudo service <service-name> <action>
or

>> sudo systemctl <action> <service-name>
<action> can be start, stop, enable, etc.

If we are doing any changes in service, it's better to reload the daemon

>> systemctl daemon-reload


To edit service file

>> sudo systemctl edit <serviceFileName> --full

you can see system files in following path

/etc/systemd/system/

To list all files

>> /etc/systemd/system/




Journalctl is a command used to manage logs

>> journalctl

To see journal with specific boot

>> journalctl -b <Boot_id>

if boot id is omiited, it show logs after latest boot


To see logs related to specific service

>> journalctl -u <servicename>

e.g.

in our flask app e.g.

we created a file flaskapp.service

>> journalctl -u flaskapp.service
