Special Permissions:

to change permissions, we used chmod

e.g. chmod 777  --->  (usere, group, others)

now these were standard permissions.

Special Permission provides special privileges.


Format---> X777---->   specialformat, user, group, others


Special permissions

1. SUID s (4)
2. SGID s (2)
3. Stickybits t (1)

SUID--> Setup userid:  A file with suid always executes as the user who owns the file, regardless the user passing the command.

SGID--> setup groupid:  If set on a file, it allows the file to be executed as the group that owns.

Sticky Bits--> This permission does not affect individual files. However at the directory level, it restricts file deletion. Only the owner(and root) of a file can remove the file within that directory.


If we set these permissions on directory then every file created in that directory will have same special permissions set.





>> chmod 4777 <filename>

above command give read-write-execute permission to user, group and others(-777)

plus

it will give setup userid permission as well(4---)


Similarly if you want to give special group permission, 

>> chmod 2777 <filename>


To set sticky bit permission

>> chmod 1777 <directory>


To remove stickybit

>> chmod -t <directory>


Now Symbolic mode

>> chmod +t <filename>

To remove

>> chmod -t <filename>

To add special user id

>> chmod u+s <filename>

To remove

>> chmod u-s <filename>

To add special group id

>> chmod g+s <filename>

To remove

>> chmod g-s <filename>
