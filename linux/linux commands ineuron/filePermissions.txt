All file and directory in Linux system is assigned 3 types of owner 
-user
-group
-others.

All file and directory in Linux system has following 3 permissions defined for all the 3 owners

--Read(r)
--Write(w)
--Execute(x)
--Nothing(-)


>> ls -lrt

it will show us information like

e.g.  

drwxr-xr-x 2 astrovishalthakur astrovishalthakur 4096 Apr 12 20:23 Videos
drwxr-xr-x 2 astrovishalthakur astrovishalthakur 4096 Apr 12 20:23 Templates
drwxr-xr-x 2 astrovishalthakur astrovishalthakur 4096 Apr 12 20:23 Public
drwxr-xr-x 2 astrovishalthakur astrovishalthakur 4096 Apr 12 20:23 Pictures


d means directory
rwx means read write execute 

To change permission of file, we use command 
--chmod



Q. What is the reason permissions are written 3 times ?
Ans. The first set pertains to the owner, the second to the owner group, and the third to everyone else.


There are two ways to change file permissions

1. Numeric mode
2. Symbolic mode


Numeric Mode:

bit          :            r   ||     w     ||      x      ||     -     ||
Action       :          read  ||   Write   ||    Execute  ||  Nothing  ||
Octal Values :           4    ||    2      ||      1      ||     -     ||      



Symbolic Mode:

chmod u+rwx/g+r-x/o-rwx filename


how to give permission in numeric mode

read = 4, write = 2, execute 1, nothing 0

suppose you want to give all permissions, then 
total permission value = 4+2+1+0 = 7

we say

>> chmod 777 <filename.txt>


e.g. to give permission as
r-xr---wx (i.e.  read-execute, read, write-execute)

we say
>> chmod 543 <filename.txt>


0 = no permission
1 = only execute
2 = only write
3 = only write and execute
4 = only read
5 = only read and execute
6 = only read and write
7 = read write and execute

e.g.
rwxr--r-x means 
user: read, write, execute
group: read
others: read, execute.








SYBOLIC MODE:

u+rwx  : giving user read write execute permission

g+r-x : giving group read but removing the execute (minus sign in front of x)


>> chmod <symbolic_mode> <file_name>

e.g. give read to all users, groups, others and remove write from all

>> chmod ugo+r-w <filename>

- Removes the specified permissions.
+ Adds specified permissions.
= Changes the current permissions to the specified permissions. If no permissions are specified after the = symbol, all permissions from the specified user class are removed.


e.g.

Give the members of the group permission to read the file, but not to write and execute it:

>> chmod g=r filename
