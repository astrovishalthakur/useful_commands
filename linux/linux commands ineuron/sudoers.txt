The sudoers file is a file linux and unix administrators use to allocate system rights to system users.

To see contents of sudoers file

>> sudo cat /etc/sudoers

We open this file using vi editor

>> sudo visudo /etc/sudoers

Then we see a field where root user has been mentioned with all permissions given
We can add our own user here by manually typing his name and giving all permissions similarly.

Then saving and closing the file.


There's a much cleaner and simpler way of doing this

if we do

>> id astrovishalthakur(root)

we will see that this user(Root) has been assigned to sudo group

So we can just add our user to this sudo group

using command

>> sudo usermod -a -G sudo <user-name>
