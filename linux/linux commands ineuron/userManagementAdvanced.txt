Different ways of creating users

- User with different home directory
- User with a specific user id
- User with a specific Group id
- Add a user to multiple Groups
- Add a user without Home directory
- User with account expiry date
- User with password expiry date
- Add a user with custom comments
- Create user login shell in linux


Create user in a directory

say we have directoy called /data/users as a home directory

then we do 

>> sudo useradd -d /data/users/ <new-user-name>

now to set password for this newly created user

>> passwd <user-name>

if permission is denied, switch to root account

>> su root

now try again setting the password.



Assign user to a group

>> sudo useradd -g <groupname> <username>


attach user to multiple groups

>> sudo usermod -a -G <group1>,<group2>,<group3> <username>


Create new user and assign to multiple groups

>> sudo useradd -G <group1>,<group2>,<group3> <new-user-name>



User with account expiry date

>> sudo useradd -e <year>-<month>-<date> <user-name>

e.g.

>> sudo useradd -e 2022-12-21 vishaluser

now to see user details

>> sudo chage -l vishaluser


We can add comments as we create user

>> sudo useradd -c "hello there. This is demo comment" <user-name>



To create user login shell

When we create user, he is assigned defaulg shell

/bin/sh  which is bourne shell

To assign it new shell, say bash shell we do:

>> sudo useradd -s /bin/bash <user-name>



To create a user with shell where it can not login

>> sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin <username>
