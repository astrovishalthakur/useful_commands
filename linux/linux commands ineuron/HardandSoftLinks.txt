Hard Links and Soft Links

Hard Links:-

Hard links acts like a mirror copy of the original file. These links share the same inodes. Changes made to the original or hard-linked file will reflect in the other.


Soft Links:-

Soft Link is an actual link to the original file also known as symbolic link or symlinks. These links will have a different inodes value. The soft link points to the original file so if the original file is deleted then the soft link
fails.

Suppose ther are two files, original and mirrored

If they are connected with hard link
If you delete original, nothing will happen to mirror.

If they are connected with soft link
If you delete original, link from softlink file will be broken.



Hardlinks have same inode number
whereas softlinks have different inode number


Hardlinks contains contents of original file whereas softlink files is just a path to original file. Like a reference.

Hardlinks can not be created for a directory.
Softlinks can be created for the directory.







COMMANDS:


To create hard link file

>> ln <originalFilename> <mirrorFileName>

To see inodes number of both files, do

>> ls -il <originalFile> <mirrorFile>

We will see that inodes number, written in the beginnig of output will be exactly same for both files.


Now we will delete original file

>> rm <originalFile>

now we will see contents of mirror file

>> cat <mirrorFile>

We will see that contents in mirror file pertains even after the original file was deleted.


Now To create soft links


>> ls -s <originalfile> <mirrorFile>

New mirror file will be created.


If we do 
>> cat <mirrofile.txt>

we will see contents of original file

now let's see node numbers

>> ls -il 

We will see both original and mirror files will have different inode numbers
also we will see that mirror file has a link to original file

originalFile -> mirrorFile

 Now we will delete original file

>> rm <original file>

now try to open mirror file

>> cat <mirror file>

it will give us error stating no such file exists.

mirror file will still be there, with broken link. You can delete it with "rm" command
