apt/apt-get

its an powerful command line tool, which works with ubuntu's advanced packaging tool(APT) performing such functions as installation of new software packages, upgrade of existing software packages, updating of the package list index, and even upgrading the entire ubuntu system.


install a package, say nmap.

>> sudo apt install nmap

we can also do apt-get

>> sudo apt-get install nmap

Difference between both is that 

apt have secure packages and should be used

apt-get also have unsecure 3rd party packages which can harm your system. So we should only use apt and not apt-get.


to remove package

>> sudo apt remove

update all repos

>> sudo apt update


Upgrade our OS

>> sudo apt upgrade


To check the sources

>> sudo apt edit-sources

search packages

>> sudo apt search <package_name>


searching using apt-get

>> apt-cache search telnel
