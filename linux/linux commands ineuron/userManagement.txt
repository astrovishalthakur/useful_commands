User Management in Linux

- create users
- delete users
- switch users

Creating users
we need root privileges

>> sudo useradd <user_name>
>> enter root password

above command only creates user, but doesn't create home directory for it

to create home directory for it as well, we need to use -m flag


with flags

>> sudo useradd <user_name> -m -s /bin/bash -g users -c "my comment"



-m creates default home directory for the user
-s allows user to use shell 
/bin/bash is shell used
-g is used for group
users is the default group
-c is used to provide comments for users

To give PASSWORD to user

>> sudo passwd <user-name>

It allows us to set password for user
if we don't write user-name, it will allow us to set password for root user


To see users

>> ls /home/

Deleting user

>> sudo userdel <user_name>

using above command deletes user and its password but doesn't delete the home directory of user.

by doing 

>> ls /home/

you will still see username home directory

It is helpful in organizations when an employee leaves, you want to delete user but keep the work he has done which is present in its home directory

to delete user and its home directory all together

>> sudo userdel -r <user-name>



Switching between users

>> su <user-name>
>> enter user password

to log in to root account

>> sudo su

Now there is another command for adding user called
>> adduser

>> sudo adduser <username>

This is built upon the native 'useradd' command

It will create user, create directory for that user (like -m flag does)
Create group of same name as user
ask us to set password as well
