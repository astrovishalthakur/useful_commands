## The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

## The command started using docker exec only runs while the containerâ€™s primary process (PID 1) is running,
## and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

>> docker exec -it b47e7da175d2 bash

## above command will open a interactive BASH of mongodb(b47e7da175d2 this can be different depending on id at that time)

## -it => -i: keep stdin(input) open even if not attached and -t: allocate a pseudo-TTY(formattable terminal.)

## we can also pass it with -u command to login as some user other than root.
