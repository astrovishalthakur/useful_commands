Docker compose have 3 versions

Docker Compose V1
Docker Compose V2
Docker Compose V3

Up until now we were discussing about V1.
V1 is now deprecated.

docker-compose in folder DockerComposeVersion1 is Version 1 so it is deprecated.

Now we will be discussing about V2 and V3.

Let's convert our docker-compose V1 to V2

go to folder DockerComposeVersion2 to see updated docker-compose file


In DockerComposeVersion1 we need to mention links to connect relevant containers.

In versions 2 and 3, docker automatically links all containers, so we don't need to mention links in docker-compose.yaml

Se new docker-compose file in DockerComposeVersion2 foler.
