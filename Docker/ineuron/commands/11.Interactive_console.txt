If we do 

>> docker run <image-name>

It will load the image and start the container, but we can't interact with the application running inside.

Meaning, we can't input any thing in it, if app requires any input.

To make the app interactive, we need to pass -i or -it command.

-i makes container interactive and -t provides it a psuedo tty terminal.

So to make container interactive, always do

>> docker run -it <image-name>

-t : Allocate a pseudo tty

-i : keep STDIN open even if not attached.
