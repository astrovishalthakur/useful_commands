Docker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications. with Compose, we can create a YAML file to define the services and with a single command, can spin everything up or tear it all down.



If we don't use docker compose

Suppose we want to run a app which uses many other services. Like cassandra for database, redis , ansible for orchestration.

To use all these things, we will have to run their images one after another.

like

docker run -d myapp
docker run -d cassandra
docker run -d redis
docekr run -d ansible


Now doker compose is a file in which we list all these services we require and it helps us to run all these with single command with other parameters as well.

file is a yml file and its name is

docker-compose.yml
