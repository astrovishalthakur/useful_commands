A container can have two references, 
1. its name given by docker, e.g. lucid_hypatia, etc.
2. its id number which are also mentioned in docker desktop

we can stop or start docker container with any refrences, e.g.

>> docker start lucid_hypatia

or 


>> docker stop 4ai33h3oj3l3oh3o33oh3oo33ho4ho4h3o3o

an id which looks like above number.

same with stopping a container.

>> docker stop lucid_hypatia

or

>> docker stop <id>
