ways to make persistent data storage in docker using volume mapping.

While working with docker container I always have a fear what if the container are deleted accidentally .
All of the data we have stored will be deleted with the deletion of the container .
To mitigate these problem we will be using docker volumes.



This method is to mount a specific directory on the host to the container.
For this let us make a new folder in the host and map that folder inside the container /data directory .



Suppose we have our data directory on host computer on following path

--/mnt/c/Users/Vishal/data

and we want to map it to container (say mysql)

now we know that mysql server stores data at location

/var/lib/mysql

so we can map local data dir to mysql dir in following way

>> docker run -v /mnt/c/Users/Vishal/data:/var/lib/mysql mysql
