We can run command in container like this

Make sure container is running.


If it is stopped, just do

>> docker start <name or id of container>

now to give commands, we can use docker exec

>> docker exec <name or ID> <command>

Suppose we have ubuntu container running

say container name is just_jelly

We want to run command cat /etc/hosts in it, we can do
 
>> docker exec just_jelly cat /etc/hosts
