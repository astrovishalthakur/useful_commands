When we start a container, it shows processes starting in terminal.

Now we can't do anything in terminal until docker container is running.

We need to start new terminal to write other commands or we have to stop the container.

We can test it by typing

>> docker run nginx

We will see docker container of nginx has been started, but now we can't write anything else until that container is running.

This happens because state of container is attached to terminal

hence the attach mode of container.


This is default mode.

To start container in deattached mode such that container keeps running in background but terminal is free for other commands, we can use deattached mode.

This is done by supplying -d flag.


>> docker run -d nginx

Now you will see that nginx container has been started but terminal is free.

See by doing 

>> docker ps 

We can also attach a deattached container to the terminal

Do the following command

>> docker attach <name or id>
