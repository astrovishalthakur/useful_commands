go to project.

Create a docker file

create it like 

"Dockerfile"

without any extensions

to see demo docker file, go to project

C:/Users/Vishal Thakur/pycharm projects/ blogpost_w_angela_version.


After writing whole docker file

let's build image

>> docker build . -t <tag-name>

e.g.

>> docker build . -t blog

. after build in above command means current directory.

-t is tag and blog is tag-name

tag is name of our image.


To build with our username

first do login

>> docker login

then

>> docker build . -t <your user name>/<tag-name>

e.g.

>> docker build . -t astrovishalthakur/blog


After that we can simply run our image

>> docker run -p 8000:5000 blog

Now you can go to browser, you can run you app on 

localhost:8000
