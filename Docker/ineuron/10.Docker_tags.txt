Pull specific version image from docker
##############################################

When we pull an image from docker hub, e.g.

>> docker run alpine

This command will pull latest image from dockerhub.

We can also pull older images with their tag numbers.

Tag numbers are like version number given to images as developers upload them.

suppose we want to pull apline image with tag number 3.12.8

we can write command

>> docker run alpine:3.12.8

To see downloaded image, we can either go to docker desktop

or do 

>> docker images
