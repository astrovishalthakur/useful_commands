When we try to run a image on docker which is not locally present, docker pulls it from remote docker hub.

now we can create many container using that image, as we did earlier.

To see images present

>> docker images

when we write 

>> docker run nginx

we create a new container from the nginx image,

now we can delete container by giving command

>> docker rm <container name>

to remove the base image

we write

>> docker rmi <image-name>

e.g.

>> docker rmi nginx
