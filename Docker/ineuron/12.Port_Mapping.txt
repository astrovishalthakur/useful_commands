When we dockerize an application,
if application wants to run inside docker,
docker container is assigned an ip-address and application run on a port.

The port assigned to docker container's application is not accessible to outside world, or internet.

So we can map the dockerized app's port to our local port

suppose we run a docker container and app in it starts.


It show that development server is running at 

http://172.17.0.2:5000

in above lines,  172.17.0.2 is the ip address assigned to our docker container and 5000 is port assigned to application.

If we want to map this 5000 port to local port(say 8000), we can type following command when starting the container


>> docker run -p 8000:5000 <container-name>


more general command is 

>> docker run -p <new-local-port>:<docker-port> <container name>


now you can access your application from host machine

go to browser and type

localhost:8000

this will start your app.

You can't access original ip address from host machine.

i.e.  172.17.0.2


we can also connect similar ports

say SQL server in docker container is running at 3060 port, then we can assign 3306 to that container on our local machine as well

>> docker run -p 3306:3306 <SQL-image>


Summary:

1. mapping is done to connect containers to outside word.
2. Apps on container runs on some port
3. Those ports are not connected to internet
4. So we map them to our local ports so that both can connect and doker port can use our local port as gateway to internet.
5. we can assign similar(5000:5000) or different (5000:8000) ports, doesn't matter.
