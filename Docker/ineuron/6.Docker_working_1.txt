Docker and VM

Docker is supposed to run processes, it uses host os for working and provides necessary apps via images.

VM is used to run whole os it them, hence they behave like whole computer with an operating system.

Docker container will exit if process running in it crashes.

VM will now stop completely even if application crashes in it.

To see the example:

We will run Ubuntu in Docker and pass command to sleep for 5 seconds.

A new container from ubuntu image will be started, command to sleep for 5 seconds will run and then it will automatically exit.

We can see stopped container docker ps -a command.

>> Docker run ubuntu sleep 5

>> Docker ps -a

We will see an ubuntu container was started and now it's stopped.
