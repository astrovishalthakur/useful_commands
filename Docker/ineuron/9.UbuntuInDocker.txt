Now let's see how to go to ubuntu bash shell in docker container

Type command

>> docker run -it ubuntu bash

This will start a ubuntu container and take us to its shell

We can run all basic commands here, this ubuntu image is very ligh-weight version of ubuntu.

If we already have a container running, we can write

>> docker exec -it <name of ID> bash

To exit we can just write

>> exit

This will log us out of the ubuntu bash and also stop the container.
