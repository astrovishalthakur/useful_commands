Express is a javascript library, or also a framework for node.

Just like how we have flask in python, Express is same.

Like flask, we create an Express Server here which listens on a specified port.

Express is a npm package and we install it like

>> npm install express

now just like flask

i.e   from flask import Flask	
	const app = Flask()
	app.run()

We have express as 

	const express = require('express')
	cost app = express()
	app.get("/", function(request, response){ response.send("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"); });
	app.listen(3000, () => { console.log('Server is up on port 3000'); });
